	title: 'Welcome to my blog!',
	image: 'images/freedom.gif',
	body: '<p>Hi! I&#39;m Christy, a native Portlander, wannabe coder, lover of beagles, pottery enthusiast. I&#39;m also an ex-Jehovah Witness and this blog is dedicated to telling my story of how I started a new life to live freely by walking away from my life, my beliefs, my family &amp; friends and community everyone I knew and built a , leaving a  highly controlling, brainwashing religion and chose to live a free life.</p><br><p>Here&#39;s my story in thirty seconds or less: I was raised by Jehovah Witness parents, and was baptized at 16. I was very good witness girl and daughter. despite losing fleshly sisters and friends who left "the truth." Throughout my teen years and early 20s, I was very active in meetings and field service, believing every Watchtower teaching. In my mid 20s things about the organization started to bother me. I decided to become a full time minister, hoping it would help me make up my mind. Shortly after, I resigned from the organization.</p>'

  	title: 'Compulsory Devotion',
  	image: '',
  	body: '<p>I was raised in a Jehovah&#39;s Witness family. Although not universally recognized as a cult, JW&#39;s fit the definition perfectly (don’t just take my word for it, read more at sites like JWfacts). Growing up, this meant that our lives revolved around JW activities — Sunday morning we met at the Kingdom Hall to listen to a talk, followed by a question and answer discussion of the current issue of the Watchtower. Monday and Tuesday evenings were spent in personal Bible study and preparing student assignments for the ministry school, which was on Wednesday evening. Thursday was the small group Bible study (this one was my favorite because we usually met at someone’s house and had desert after). Friday was used to prepare for the ministry, and Saturday was spend going door-to-door and driving around trying to find someone to &#34;witness&#34; to. Then there&#39;s the twice yearly 2-day assembly where we met in a really big Kingdom Hall with hundreds of other JW&#39;s and the 3 day annual convention, which was basically the same thing but bigger. These repeated activities, although presented as ways to draw closer to out god (and away from the world) was really just an infinite loop of boredom and brainwashing.</p><p>The little free time we had was usually spent together. I didn’t have many friends because we weren’t allowed to play with “worldly,” or non-JW children, outside of school hours. Actually, my mom would scold me if I referred to a class mate as a “friend.” Family visits with non-JW aunts, uncles and cousins were always kept short and highly supervised, since they could potentially be “bad influences” and we always needed “keep our guards up.” Since it was against our beliefs to celebrate birthdays and holidays, socializing on those occasions were strictly forbidden. Thankfully my sisters and I were allowed to watch TV, but everything from the Simpsons to Fantasia was considered bad and even watching one minute of it was forbidden. Surprisingly I got used to this kind of monopoly on my time and relationships, but it\&#39;s not like I knew any different.</p>&#39;'

  	title: 'Do Not Use the "World to the Full"',
  	image: '',
  	body: '<p>In my teen years, both of my older free-spirited sisters broke free from the church and out parents control, leading to their removal from the congregation, our home and total ex-communication from me and my parents. It was really traumatic see my family divided and the pain of loosing my sisters was unbearable. With two children lost to Satan’s “wicked” world, my parents were not taking any chances with their me, their youngest and most submissive daughter. So they beefed up surveillance on my daily whereabouts, associates, activities, pursuits and general doings 24/7. Dreams of a university education were quickly extinguished and replaced with goals of becoming a full-time minister and finding a perfect JW husband.</p><p>In high school I excelled in math and science, and thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning new and complicated subjects. My teachers and guidance counselors encouraged me to take AP classes and apply for scholarships in engineering. Sadly JW leaders strongly advise parents not to allow their children to attend universities or purse a “higher education” for fear this might lead them astray (see the Watchtower article “Parents — What Future Do You Want for Your Children?”). So my parents were constantly warning me of the dangers of colleges and the consequences if I choose to attend. I was persuaded to learn some kind of trade so I can work part-time to support my full-time evangelizing. Not wanting to displease my parents, I gave up my educational desires and maneuvered to go to community college. In just two short years (which took a lot of persuading to go that long) I finished my barely challenging engineering tech degree and landed a promising part-time engineering job.</p><p>Over the years I learned an essential skill to be a Jehovah’s Witnesses is learning how not to live up to your potential. I had thousands of examples to learn from, like JW’s that turned down ivy league scholarships to work as janitors or window washers. Women that were natural leaders choosing silent submission because of their gender. Talented artists persuaded to demote their talents to a hobby in order make room for the ministry. Ambitious people with aspirations for a successful career forced into mediocrity so as not to risk becoming “enslaved to riches.” It’s hard to imagine, but living in this world where literally everything is a threat to your spirituality and relationship with god, underachieving or sabotaging your success was recognized as an act of godly devotion.</p><p>Despite my parent’s fears and criticism from the congregation elders, a college degree and a good job did not make me fall out of “the truth.” On the contrary, I was able to secure part-time hours, so I could devote the rest of my time to the ministry. Since I was becoming a master underachiever, I managed to keep my job challenging enough to say engaged, but not challenging enough to get excited. So worked in a kind of ambition neutralizing environment, where I didn’t need to expend much brain power to do my job. Deep down I knew I was capable of more and owed it to myself to find out.'

  	title: 'Reunion',
  	image: '',
  	body: '<p>It had been almost ten years since I had contact with my sister Missy. We were close a kids until she left the church and eventually I was no longer allowed to have contact with her and was forced to sever ties and not return her calls or texts. My mother even forced me to change me phone number for that reason. During that time apart I missed her terribly. I cried everytime I thought about her and carried that pain in my heart everyday. Right after I knew I was going to leave the church, I sent the email below in an effort to rekindle our relationship. I was excited, but also nervous because I wasn&#39;t sure how a decade of shunning has altered our sisterly bond.</p><div class="fromMsg"><p>Jun 2, 2015 3:52 PM</br>I found your email from your website so I hope you don&#39;t mind sending a message to it. I know contacting you now might come as a surprise, but I would really like to talk to you. I miss you and it&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve acted like you sister and I really regret it. Mom and Dad don&#39;t know I&#39;ve been trying to get a hold of you, and I have&#39;t told Amy. This might sound weird but I don\'t want them to know just yet. I really hope you want to see me, there&#39;s so much I want to tell you.</br>Love,</br>Christy</p></div><div class="toMsg"><p>June 24, 2015 3:56 PM</br>I want to see you everyday.</br>I think of you often and you\'ve never been far from my heart.</br>When are you free next?</br>I respect your wishes on who knows what.</p></div><p>We met that following Friday, hugged, talked and cried. I can only describe reuniting with my sister as one of the happiest days of my life.</p>'
