  	body: '<p>I&#39;ve been asked many times &#34;Why did you leave your religion?&#34; from both ex-JWs and non-ex-JWs. My default answer has usually been something related to the false doctrine I uncovered or the controlling nature of religion or the scandalous lies told by the leaders, etc., etc., etc.</p>'

    + '<p>Ok, sure, I can &#34;prove by references&#34; the faulty teachings and lies of Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses. But although all of that is true and without a doubt legitimate reasons for leaving, the fact that <em>I wasn&#39;t happy</em> should&#39;ve been reason enough.</p>'

    +'<p>It took me past year since I&#39;ve been out of the cult to realize that my feelings are valid and superior to those of any religion I am apart of, person I know or organization that I belong to. I don&#39;t need to justify the decision I made to anyone, because I know I make the right choice for me.</p>'

    + '<p>Looking back, I see that some of why I didn&#39;t leave sooner was because I wanted to compile concrete evidence-based reasons for leaving. Of course, I am glad that I did all of that research, but because I felt such a strong need to do so, shows how little value I put on my own feelings of happiness and well being. So in order for me to muster up the courage to change my life, I felt that I had to look outward for validation, when the whole time I had the most compelling reason to leave within me. I just didn&#39;t know how to listen to my internal voice telling me to get out! (And that&#39;s how I know I was brainwashed.)</p>'

    body: '<p>One night while I was secretly investigating Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses on the web, I decided to read about what ex-Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses had to say. To make a well informed decision to leave my religion, I needed to hear what both sides had to say and I have already done exhausting amounts of research from Watchtower publications. I realized this would be directly seeking out &#34;apostates,&#34; but I reasoned that all I would do is just see what they had to say then make up my own mind.</p>'

    + '<p>Much of what I found, seemed drenched with anger and sarcasm and that&#39;s not what I was looking for. Then I came across <a href=”http://exjehovahswitnessportland.blogspot.com/”>Joel&#39;s blog</a>. The fact that it was made by and for people from my hometown peeked my curiosity and &#34;Gunz&#34; sounded familiar. So with an open mind, I read every word of his blog. Then I read it again. Although I was very interested in the content of the blog, what struck me most what Joel&#39;s obnoxious optimism. At that time, I was very depressed. Stuck in a monotonous life of self-denial and servitude. I knew I needed out, but I was raised and brainwashed to believe that this meant I was a rebelling against the almighty and would die in Armageddon (which will any day now).</p>'

    + '<p>Then I read it again the next night and decided that I needed to talk to this guy. I needed to know how he survived. Plus, I wanted someone to tell me I can survive it too. He has an open invitation to any who would like to talk with him, so the next day I clicked the link and sent a complete stranger this message:</p>'

      + '<div class="fromMsg"><p>From: Christy<br>Sent: May 16, 2015<br><br>Hi Joel,<br>I came across your ex-jw blog and I&#39;m hoping that I can ask you a question about leaving &#39;the truth.&#39; I realize this is rather personal, so I completely understand if you do not reply.</p>'

      + '<p>First, just a little about me. I was baptized 11 years ago and I am a regular pioneer. Never in my life have I dedicated myself to Jehovah as much as I am now, and never have I felt this unhappy. So I know something is definitely wrong in my life. In the past I would have choose death over leaving the congregation, but I&#39;m reconsidering, seeing as how I&#39;m gonna die eventually (there&#39;s no way I can make it into the &#39;new world&#39;). I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m becoming an &#39;unbeliever&#39; or losing faith in Jehovah, I just feel that I can&#39;t live up to being a witness and that they will be better off without me.</p>'

      + '<p>So after reading your blog, I decided to email you even at the risk of the insane amount of trouble I&#39;ll get in if anyone finds out. My question is this: were you scared to be disfellowshipped? If so how did you deal with that?</p>'

      + '<p>The thought of being alone in this world, is frightening to me. I don&#39;t know if I can emotionally or financially take care of myself. I&#39;ve never been on my own, and I might be too weak, nieve, or a coward to make it in the world. Plus, I don&#39;t like confrontation or talking to elders about my problems and I really really really don&#39;t want to hurt my family and friends by leaving, so I haven&#39;t decided either way yet.</p>'

      + '<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this random email from a total stranger :-) I look forward to hearing back from you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Christy</p></div>'

    + '<p>This email changed my life. I thought &#34;OMG! he actually replied! That must mean he IS real.&#34;</p>'

      + '<div class="toMsg"><p>From: Joel<br>Sent: May 25, 2015<br><br>Hi Christy,<br>Thanks for getting in touch. I&#39;m so sorry for the delayed reply.  My Ex-JW blog is connected to an email account I rarely use.  (I need to update that.)</p>'

      + '<p>It sounds like you&#39;re at a crossroads in life. Disfellowshipping was probably the most terrifying experience of my life. I felt like I was dying--losing all of my friends, family and even business contacts. But the funny thing is, afterward, I immediately felt a lift, like a 200-pound blanket was being lifted off of me and I could be free for the first time in my life. It still wasn&#39;t easy, but I found that it was something I could live with and adjust to. I definitely took advantage of that freedom and sowed a few wild oats, but I think that&#39;s normal. And I&#39;m a good guy, so eventually, I balanced out. I got therapy too. :)</p>'

      + '<p>I&#39;m curious to hear more of your story. Where are you from? What&#39;s going on that makes you think you won&#39;t make it into the paradise? Is everything ok?<br><br>Best,<br>Joel<br></div>'

    + '<p>Yep, he was right. I was at a crossroads. Despite digging my heals in the ground to prevent arriving there. I realized that I couldn&#39;t sit on the fence forever.</p>'

      + '<div class="fromMsg"><p>From: Christy<br>Sent: May 24, 2015<br><br>Hi Joel,<br>Thanks for getting back to me. I guess I had this wrong notion that when people get disfellowshipped, they&#39;re hardened, and don&#39;t feel. I&#39;ve been on the other end, having ones close to me leave and be disfellowshipped, and the pain and loss I felt was comparable to a death.</p>'

      + '<p>There&#39;s not much to my story, I&#39;m 28, single, raised as JW, parents are JWs, one disfellowshipped sister and one disassociated sister (both as teenagers). Although I&#39;ve always been strong and active witness, I&#39;ve had a couple of crossroad situations in my life. The first was ten years ago when I had to decide about college. I chose a 2 year school and eventually found a part time engineering job, so I could go in service during the week. The second crossroad was about a year ago, when I made a friend in the world. I walked away from him and stayed a JW. I felt I was making the right decision, and since I was now unemployed, started regular pioneering. So now I&#39;m at my third crossroad, although it always comes down to be a JW or not.</p>'

      + '<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make it into paradise because I doubt I&#39;ll meet the many requirements. Plus when I realized that my lifestyle - that I created by giving up things, leaving people I love, missing opportunities, constantly exhausting myself - is not making me happy or more devoted, that put a huge crack in my faith. We teach that happiness come from serving Jehovah, well I&#39;m serving Jehovah, a lot, and I&#39;m not happy. This got me questioning more of what I believe and if I still believe it. Yesterday I started thinking about if I still love Jehovah, but that strong intense feeling that I&#39;ve had my entire life, is now gone. I feel nothing.</p>'

      + '<p>I know I still have a ton of figuring out to do, but being a JW you really can&#39;t start going around questioning things without drawing attention. But I need to do it quickly, I don&#39;t want to be hypocrite or mislead people. If I&#39;m classified as &#39;wicked&#39; or &#39;repentant sinner&#39; or whatever, I&#39;ll own up to it. Just don&#39;t want to live a lie.</p>'

      + 'My bigger problem is that right now I work only two days, just barely enough to get by, even though I rent from my parents really cheaply. I&#39;ve been (secretly) trying to find some full time work, so I can move on my own. But I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll kick me out before then, when they find all this out. I really don&#39;t want to put my parents in that situation, I&#39;d rather leave of my own doing.<br><br>Thanks for listening,<br>Christy<br><br>Btw, I&#39;m in Portland and Gunz sounds super familiar...</p></div>'

    + '<p>We exchanged more emails and then decided to meet for coffee. I was so terrified that someone would find out, I called in sick to work, so that, hopefully, no one would know that I met with an apostate.</p>'

    + '<p>I remember getting ready to meet Joel, I was so nervous! I couldn&#39;t eat or sit still. I never met a man alone before, especially an ex-JW. I was also excited. But it felt great to actually do something and not just think about doing something. Although I had read every page of his blog and googled him and his girlfriend (actually, his ex-girlfriend) extensively, I was still a tad bit afraid. From all the scary things that I was told about apostates, I was afraid that he might come with fresh blood on his hands from sacrificing babies to satan (I literally checked his hands for blood). But instead, I was delighted to meet this incredibly smart, kind and funny man that listened patiently to woes of a sad witness girl.</p>'

    + '<p>He told me about his experience as a JW, and how he recovered. I told him about all the things I think is wrong with the organization and how tight of grip my parents have on my life. We had only about an hour together to talk, but agreed to meet up again.</p>'

    + '<p>Driving home from that meeting, the enormity of my situation hit me. It was now real. Was I ready to make this change? Do I really mean the things I&#39;m staying? Believe the things I&#39;m thinking? I couldn&#39;t just up and leave my life without being sure, really really sure. So I dived into research. I read websites, blogs, books and listened to podcasts, whatever I could get my hands on. The evidence was overwhelming. I remember while reading Crisis of Conscience, I had my reference Bible, Proclaimers book, my great-grandmothers Aid book side-by-side checking the citations and verifying what I read. I couldn&#39;t believe my own eyes. I sat stunned looking at these books, with a completely different view. The evidence of the lies because so overwhelming, I broke down in tears many times.</p>'

    + '<p>Just as Joel had said, it all started to unravel. The more I dug, the more I found out about the Witnesses. Feeling of anger, hurt, grief and frustration welled up inside me. This wasn&#39;t hidden information, it was just not the version of the truth that I read in the Watchtower. I felt so stupid, all these years only believing what was given to me and not what was right in front of me.</p>'

    + '<p>But the worst realization of them all, was that I was part of the lie. Here I was, perfect little pioneer sister, with a ton of return visits, having Bible studies all the time, spreading the deception and enforcing the mind control. It made me sick to my stomach to think of all the people I convinced of JW&#39;s doctrine. It was then that I knew it was time to head for the exit.</p>'

    caption: 'My family at a Circuit Assembly in Woodburn, Oregon, early 90\'s, I\'m the one with the bad hair',
    body: '<p>I was raised in a Jehovah&#39;s Witness family. Although not universally recognized as a cult, JW&#39;s fit the definition perfectly (don&#39;t just take my word for it, read more at sites like JWfacts). Growing up, this meant that our lives revolved around JW activities.</p>'
    + '<p>Sunday morning we met at the Kingdom Hall to listen to a talk, followed by a question and answer discussion of the current issue of the Watchtower. Monday and Tuesday evenings were spent in personal Bible study and preparing student assignments for the ministry school, which was on Wednesday evening. Thursday was the small group Bible study (this one was my favorite because we usually met at someone&#39;s house and had desert after).'
    + ' Friday was used to prepare for the ministry, and Saturday was spend going door-to-door and driving around trying to find someone to &#34;witness&#34; to. Then there&#39;s the twice yearly 2-day assembly where we met in a really big Kingdom Hall with hundreds of other JW&#39;s and the 3 day annual convention, which was basically the same thing but bigger. These repeated activities, although presented as ways to draw closer to out god (and away from the world) was really just an infinite loop of boredom and brainwashing.</p>'

    + '<p>The little free time we had was usually spent together. I didn’t have many friends because we weren’t allowed to play with &#34;worldly,&#34; or non-JW children, outside of school hours. Actually, my mom would scold me if I referred to a class mate as a &#34;friend.&#34; Family visits with non-JW aunts, uncles and cousins were always kept short and highly supervised, since they could potentially be &#34;bad influences&#34; and we always needed &#34;keep our guards up.&#34; Since it was against our beliefs to celebrate birthdays and holidays, socializing on those occasions were strictly forbidden. Thankfully my sisters and I were allowed to watch TV, but everything from the Simpsons to Fantasia was considered bad and even watching one minute of it was forbidden. Surprisingly I got used to this kind of monopoly on my time and relationships, but it&#39;s not like I knew any different.</p>'

    + '<p>In my teen years, both of my older free-spirited sisters broke free from the church and out parents control, leading to their removal from the congregation, our home and total ex-communication from me and my parents. It was really traumatic see my family divided and the pain of loosing my sisters was unbearable. With two children lost to Satan’s &#34;wicked&#34; world, my parents were not taking any chances with their me, their youngest and most submissive daughter. So they beefed up surveillance on my daily whereabouts, associates, activities, pursuits and general doings 24/7. Dreams of a university education were quickly extinguished and replaced with goals of becoming a full-time minister and finding a perfect JW husband.</p>'

    + '<p>In high school I excelled in math and science, and thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning new and complicated subjects. My teachers and guidance counselors encouraged me to take AP classes and apply for scholarships in engineering. Sadly JW leaders strongly advise parents not to allow their children to attend universities or purse a &#34;higher education&#34; for fear this might lead them astray (see the Watchtower article <a target="_blank" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2005726">Parents - What Future Do You Want for Your Children?</a>).'
    + ' So my parents were constantly warning me of the dangers of colleges and the consequences if I choose to attend. I was persuaded to learn some kind of trade so I can work part-time to support my full-time evangelizing. Not wanting to displease my parents, I gave up my educational desires and maneuvered to go to community college. In just two short years which took a lot of persuading to go that long I finished my barely challenging engineering tech degree and landed a promising part-time engineering job.</p>'

    + '<p>Over the years I learned an essential skill to be a Jehovah’s Witnesses is learning how not to live up to your potential. I had thousands of examples to learn from, like JW’s that turned down ivy league scholarships to work as janitors or window washers. Women that were natural leaders choosing silent submission because of their gender. Talented artists persuaded to demote their talents to a hobby in order make room for the ministry. Ambitious people with aspirations for a successful career forced into mediocrity so as not to risk becoming &#34;enslaved to riches.&#34; It’s hard to imagine, but living in this world where literally everything is a threat to your spirituality and relationship with god, underachieving or sabotaging your success was recognized as an act of godly devotion.</p>'

    + '<p>Despite my parent’s fears and criticism from the congregation elders, a college degree and a good job did not make me fall out of &#34;the truth.&#34; On the contrary, I was able to secure part-time hours, so I could devote the rest of my time to the ministry. Since I was becoming a master underachiever, I managed to keep my job challenging enough to say engaged, but not challenging enough to get excited. So worked in a kind of ambition neutralizing environment, where I didn’t need to expend much brain power to do my job. Deep down I knew I was capable of more and owed it to myself to find out, but would never get that opportunity.</p>'

    caption: 'Meeting my sister after almost 10 years apart',
    body: '<p>It had been almost ten years since I had contact with my sister Missy. We were close a kids and teenagers. But our relationship was abrubtly severed when she decided to leave the church and move out at 17. She was considered &#34;bad association&#34; and my parents feared I would follow in her footsteps. So they limited my contact with her, at first just severly limited and hightly supervised. But eventually I was no longer allowed to have contact with her at all, and was forced not to return her calls or texts. My mother even made change me phone number so she would not be able to contact me.</p>'

    + '<p>During that time apart I missed her terribly. I cried every time I thought about her and carried that pain in my heart everyday. I knew she loved me, and although I couldne&#39;t understand why she left, I hoped wee&#39;d be reunited someday. Fastforward to over a decade as I finally decided that I was going to leave the church, I sent the email below in an effort to rekindle our relationship. I was excited, but also nervous because I wasn&#39;t sure how a decade of shunning has altered our sisterly bond.</p>'

      + '<div class="fromMsg"><p>From: Christy<br>Sent: Jun 2, 2015 3&#58;52 PM<br><br>I found your email from your website so I hope you don&#39;t mind sending a message to it. I know contacting you now might come as a surprise, but I would really like to talk to you. I miss you and it&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve acted like you sister and I really regret it. Mom and Dad don&#39;t know I&#39;ve been trying to get a hold of you, and I haven&#39;t told Amy. This might sound weird but I don&#39;t want them to know just yet. I really hope you want to see me, there&#39;s so much I want to tell you.<br>Love,<br>Christy</p></div>'
