<p>Hi! I&#39;m Christy, a native Portlander, wannabe coder, lover of beagles, and pottery enthusiast. I&#39;m also an ex-JW (Jehovah Witness) and this blog is dedicated to telling my story about leaving and moving on.</p>



<!-- <h2>Welcome to my blog!</h2> -->
<!-- <p>Here&#39;s my story in thirty seconds or less&#58;</p>
<p>I was raised by Jehovah Witness parents, and was baptized at 16. I was very good witness girl and daughter. Despite &#34;losing&#34; fleshly sisters and friends to &#34;the world,&#34; throughout my teen years and early 20s, I was very active in meetings and field service. I was definitely drinking the kool-aid and firmly believed every Watchtower teaching. In my mid 20s some things about the organization started to bother me. But instead of leaving, I decided to become a full time minister, hoping it would help me make up my mind. Shortly after, I resigned from the organization and started a new life free of control and inauthenticity.</p> -->
